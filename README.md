# GoalBook


Stay accountable and celebrate success together with GoalBook - the social media app that makes productivity a social event.

GoalBook is a social media app that aims to harness the power of social media to promote productivity and accountability. The app allows users to share their goals with their friends and create daily checklists with deadlines that can be seen by their friends. By sharing their goals and progress, users can motivate themselves to achieve their goals and stay accountable to their commitments.

The app uses the concept of social pressure to encourage users to complete their checklists before the deadlines. If a user is approaching a deadline, the app will remind them of their impending deadline, creating a sense of urgency to complete their tasks before the deadline. By completing their checklists on time, users can avoid the embarrassment of not meeting their commitments in front of their friends.

GoalBook also allows users to celebrate their victories and share their accomplishments with their friends. This feature creates a positive and supportive community where users can cheer each other on and celebrate their successes together.

Overall, GoalBook is a powerful productivity tool that helps users stay motivated and accountable while creating a supportive community of friends.
